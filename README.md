# MANAWOVEN

> Started August 22nd, 2025

This project is - hopefully - my first long-term game that I will finish almost completely be myself. I'm going to try and scope it to take me about 3 years.

The plan is a 2.5D / 3D + Orthographic Camera Platforming Roguelike - running through procedurally generated rooms instead of fighting through them.
